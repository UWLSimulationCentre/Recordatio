# Disciplulus Hub PowerApp Mobile App

From Latin, *Recordatio* translates to ***Recording***. This mobile application provides staff watching OSCE Exams within our [Simulation Centres](https://www.uwl.ac.uk/business/university-venue-hire/medical-simulation-centre), a system to mark timings and camera details to allow Technicians an easier method of editing and reviewing following the exams.
